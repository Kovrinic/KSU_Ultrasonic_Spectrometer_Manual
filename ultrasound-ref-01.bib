	abstract = {This work presents an investigation carried out to apply a broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy technique to the study of membrane filters. The technique is based on the analysis of the amplitude spectra of broadband airborne ultrasonic pulses transmitted through filter membranes. In particular, analysis of the through thickness resonances is used. Density of the membrane and velocity and attenuation of sound waves are obtained. These magnitudes are correlated to other properties of the membrane like porosity, pore size, water flow and bubble point. Observed relations suggest that this technique can be used as a filter integrity test and as a non-invasive characterization procedure.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to develop an ultrasonic reflectance spectrometer to non-destructively detect changes in bubble characteristics in aerated foods. A theory was developed to relate ultrasonic reflectance spectra to bubble characteristics. Experiments were carried out using foams with different bubble concentrations and sizes prepared by mechanical agitation of a viscous aqueous solution (1.4\% xanthan and 8\% whey protein). The complex acoustic impedance of the foams was calculated from measurements of their ultrasonic reflectance from 1 to 7 MHz. The acoustic impedance spectra varied with bubble size and concentration in a manner that was qualitatively predicted by the theory. Our results show that ultrasonic reflectance spectrometry (URS) is sensitive to changes in bubble size and concentration of aerated foods, but that more work is needed to do this quantitatively.},

	abstract = {When instant milk powder (IMP) is reconstituted with water, the product should resemble fresh milk. However, undissolved particles were found at the surface and in the bulk of the product. A visual reconstitution test (RT) is made on IMP to determine the reconstituted quality of the product. This test is directly linked to the presence of the undissolved particles. The particles found at the surface are formed by clustered liquid-fat aggregates, which rise to the top of the milk and may give an impression of spoiled milk. The particles found in the bulk are small particles in the solution mostly composed of a protein gel. Because the repeatability and precision of the RT are very poor, a quantitative analytical technique is desirable. In this study we investigated five different quality milk powders by an ultrasound spectroscopy technique. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation parameters were measured with a frequency scanning pulse echo reflectometer. We found that the ultrasonic velocity cannot be correlated to RT because the predominant phenomenon that affects the ultrasonic velocity is the physical state of the different components of the milk matrix (liquid fat, crystalline fat and lactose crystals), and this physical state is not a significant factor in powder quality. However, the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient is well correlated with RT. This is because, between two different quality powders, the most important factor that causes variation in the attenuation is scattering, correlated to particle size and to volume fraction rather than by the composition or physical state of the matrix and the same particle size factor, and volume fraction factor characterizes the powder reconstitution's quality.},

For each parameter set (based on a mel-frequency cepstrum, a linear frequency cepstrum, a linear prediction cepstrum, a linear prediction spectrum, or a set of reflection coefficients), word templates were generated using an efficient dynamic warping method, and test data were time registered with the templates. A set of ten mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients computed every 6.4 ms resulted in the best performance, namely 96.5 percent and 95.0 percent recognition with each of two speakers. The superior performance of the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients may be attributed to the fact that they better represent the perceptually relevant aspects of the short-term speech spectrum.},

Beginning from a common model of Brillouin scattering, the bulk viscosity is shown to play an important role in Brillouin linewidth determination. Pulse durations of SBS back-reflected optical pulses are measured over the temperature range of 5-40 oC. SBS linewidths are determined via Fourier transformation of the time-domain results, and the bulk viscosity of water is measured and derived from the obtained values. Our results show that the proposed method for measurement of pulse durations is an effective approach for determining bulk viscosity.

Two skim milks recombined from powder samples differing by their preheating treatments as well as dairy ingredients (phosphocasein, whey protein isolate, and a milk model) were monitored while submitted to a temperature of 120°C. Three stages in the precoagulation and coagulation processes can be distinguished in the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation profiles. The first stage shows a very sharp decrease in ultrasonic velocity and increase in ultrasonic attenuation. This could be attributed to fast denaturation and aggregation of whey proteins and precipitation of calcium phosphate. In the second stage, small changes in ultrasonic velocity are observed, the rate of which depends on the nature and pH of the samples. In the third stage, a sharp decrease in ultrasonic velocity and attenuation is recorded for all samples, which corresponds to the coagulation and formation of the gel network. After coagulation, a very small change in ultrasonic velocity and attenuation was observed. From the ultrasonic measurements, we determined the heat stability vs. pH profiles of the different samples studied. The observed ultrasonic attenuation profiles were also interpreted in terms of changes in the size of casein micelles and coagulation processes.},

The amplitudes of echoes from the interface are used to calculate the interface reflection coefficient and, from this and a knowledge of the properties of the substrate material, the unknown impedance is obtained. The technique has potential for assessment of adhesive cure and measurement of mechanical moduli. The calculation is poorly conditioned in that small errors in raw echo data can result in unacceptably large errors in the estimate of the required impedance. This paper gives an analysis which demonstrates how bias and variance errors in raw data lead to bias and variance errors in the calculated reflection coefficient and how these lead to errors in impedance estimation which can be very much greater and which depend on the value of the coefficient of reflection at the interface. Experimental results are given which verify the analytical predictions of the error generation process. The effects of interface conditions such as transducer coupling film and paint coatings are considered quantitatively by a simulation of the wave system. The effects of substrate surface roughness are considered briefly in a series of experiments.},

	abstract = {Wave propagation in viscoelastic disk layers is encountered in many applications including studies of airborne ultrasonic transducers. For viscoelastic materials, both material and geometric dispersion are possible when the diameter of the matching layer is of the same order as the wavelength. Lateral motions of the matching layer(s) that result from the Poisson effect are accounted by using a new concept called the “effective-density”. A new wave equation is derived for both metallic and non-metallic (polymeric) materials, usually employed for the matching layers of airborne ultrasonic transducer. The material properties are modeled by using the Kelvin model for metals and Linear Solid Standard model for non-metallic (polymeric) matching layers. The utilized model of the material of the matching layers has influence on amount and trend of variation in speed ratio. In this regard, 60\% reduction in speed ratio is observed for Kelvin model for aluminum with diameter of 80 mm at 100 kHz while for a similar diameter but Standard Linear Model, the speed ratio increase to twice value at 15 kHz, and then reduced until 70\% at 67 kHz for Polypropylene. The new wave theory simplifies to the one-dimensional solution for waves in metallic or polymeric matching layers if the Poisson ratio is set to zero. The predictions simplify to Love’s equation for stress waves in elastic disks when loss term is removed from equations for both models. Afterwards, the new wave theory is employed to determine the airborne ultrasonic matching layers to maximize the energy transmission to the air. The optimal matching layers are determined by using genetic algorithm theory for 1, 2 and 3 airborne matching layers. It has been shown that 1-D equation is useless at frequencies less than 100 kHz and the effect of diameter of the matching layers must be considered to determine the acoustic impedances (matching layers) to design airborne ultrasonic transducers.},

	abstract = {A new technique is developed to determine the dispersion relation and the propagational speeds of waves in dispersive solids. The phase spectrum of a broadband pulse is linearly related to the dispersion relation of the dispersive medium. The method is simpler than the continuous‐wave phase comparison technique. Application is made to measure the phase and group velocities of waves in fiber‐reinforced composite materials and in thin wires. This technique is expected to be applicable to measurements of acoustic or electromagnetic wave speeds in other dispersive media.},

	abstract = {An ultrasonic pulse type apparatus was used to measure the speed of sound in distilled water over the pressure range 14.7 to 14 000 psia and the temperature range 0.9 to 91.2°C. The temperature where the maximum sound speed occurs shifts to a higher temperature when the pressure is increased. At atmospheric pressure the computed maximum speed was 1555.36 m/sec and occurred at a temperature of 74.164°C. The isotherms of sound speed, plotted as a function of pressure, are concave upward below 20°C, concave downward above 20°C, and are approximately linear near 20°C for the pressure range of 14.7 to 14 000 psia. These curvatures have a maximum value of 1 part in 300 compared to the estimated accuracy of measurement which is 1 part in 10 000. The results are presented in tables and also in the form of a fourth degree equation fitted to the experimental data by the method of least squares.},

	abstract = {Despite its fundamental role in the dynamics of compressible fluids, bulk viscosity has received little experimental attention and there remains a paucity of measured data. Acoustic spectroscopy provides a robust and accurate approach to measuring this parameter. Working from the Navier-Stokes model of a compressible fluid one can show that the bulk viscosity makes a significant and measurable contribution to the frequency-squared acoustic attenuation. Here we employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over a temperature range of 7 to 50°C. The measured attenuation spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk viscosity of water is found to be approximately three times larger than its shear counterpart, reinforcing its significance in acoustic propagation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that this technique can be readily and generally applied to fluids to accurately determine their temperature dependent bulk viscosities.},

An on line computer performing Fourier analysis of sampled ultrasonic pulses allowed both amplitude and phase information to be studied. Layers of various acoustic impedances, velocities, and attenuation have been investigated, and in particular, layers of magnetite grown on mild steel. In all cases excellent agreement between experiment and theory has been achieved. The possible use of the techniques of deconvolution has also been considered for the measurement of the thickness of layers. The methods developed have found application in the problem of determining the thickness of a corrosion layer on the inside surface of a component where access can only be gained through the outer surface.},

	abstract = {Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is a semi-analytical technique that can be used to calculate the ultrasonic field (pressure, velocity and displacement fields in a fluid, or stress and displacement fields in a solid) generated by ultrasonic transducers. So far the technique has been used to model ultrasonic fields in homogeneous and multilayered fluid structures, and near a fluid–solid interface when a solid half-space is immersed in a fluid. In this paper, the method is extended to model the ultrasonic field generated in a homogeneous isotropic solid plate immersed in a fluid. The objective of this study is to model the generation of guided waves in a solid plate when ultrasonic beams from transducers of finite dimension strike the plate at different critical angles. DPSM results for a solid half-space problem are compared with the finite element predictions to show the superiority of the DPSM technique. The predicted results are also compared with the experimental visualization of the mode patterns of Lamb waves propagating in a glass plate obtained from stroboscopic photoelastic method. Experimental and theoretical results show good qualitative agreement. The DPSM technique is then applied to study the mode patterns in aluminum plates immersed in water.},
